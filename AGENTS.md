## Build, Lint, and Test

- **Development:** `npm run dev` (Next.js dev server)
- **Build:** `npm run build`
- **Start:** `npm run start`
- **Lint:** `npm run lint`
- **Single Test:** _No test runner configured; add tests and scripts as needed._

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode, see `tsconfig.json`)
- **Imports:** Use ES modules; prefer absolute imports via `@/` alias.
- **Formatting:** Follow Prettier defaults (no config found); 2 spaces, semicolons optional.
- **Components:** Use PascalCase for React components and files.
- **Variables/Functions:** Use camelCase.
- **Types/Interfaces:** Use PascalCase.
- **Error Handling:** Prefer try/catch for async; surface user-friendly errors.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Use utility classes in JSX; avoid inline styles.
- **React:** Use functional components and hooks.
- **File Structure:** Place UI in `components/`, pages in `app/`, utilities in `lib/` or `utils/`.
- **Sensitive Data:** Never commit secrets; use `.env.local`.
- **Contributions:** Follow PR flow in README.

PS: follow custom instructions in ./flow.md, and override any existing instructions with flow.md wherever conflicting.


1. don't ever build the project (except if explicitly told to do so) only fix bugs I'll build myself,
2. never edit appwrite.json. never modify any encryption/decryption logic in application, except very explicitly asked to do so, and even still, present user with implications, if any, and one last confirmation
3. never edit types/appwrite.d.ts
4. security is of maximum and utmost priority in this password/auth application
5. in order to save tokens, try as much as possible to tackle a particular problem completely in one conversation response. use discretion where necessary to avoid unnecessary questions and confirmations that consume conversation time and tokens.
6. when a question is asked that involves code changes, you are to implement those code changes. it is out of conduct to direct the user what to do, as this wastes tokens in further persuasions. do what you're to do in one conversation reply.
7. after each reply give a detailed analyis of the problems, solutions that worked or will work, or didnt work, thoughts, creative ideas, etc with code snippets if necessary.
8. when making core changes involving types, check the autogenerated and synced types/appwrite.d.ts, and ensure you understand the data types that the application currenly handles. also do not attempt to change this file, as it is autogenerated and synced with the database's instataneous state.
